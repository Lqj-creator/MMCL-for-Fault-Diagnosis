# MMCL-for-Fault-Diagnosis
We propose a novel semi-supervised learning framework for fault diagnosis in scenarios with limited labeled data, using a Multiscale and Multilevel Contrastive Learning (MMCL) approach. We will upload our code and processed dataset in about a month, mainly using CWRU and PHM public datasets.
